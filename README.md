# button-box

The goal is to create a silly web app that can be used like an app on an iphone using the "add to home screen" option in
safari.

The app should open in full screen mode without the safari url bar and other browser elements.

The app will be a knock off of the "big button box" app that was popular in the early iphone days.

Each button will play a sound when pressed.

The app should be deployable in the simplest way possible using google cloud - I will create a project for this app. 
Once you have created the app, I will expect deploy instructions that are automated on pushes to the main branch of a 
github repo.

I am open to using any web framework you think is best suited for this app.

Here are the buttons I want to start with:

- Boys Roll
- Girls Roll
- Здравствуйте
- GMAFBP
- нет
- Pig Out
- Double Leaning Jowler
- Kids back down the mines
- Enough
- YEAHHHHH
- Towel

Assume the sounds will be bundled with the app and will be in the same directory as the HTML file.

Assume that new sounds will need to be added routinely.

Create a plan first and run it by me before you start coding - ask any questions up front.
